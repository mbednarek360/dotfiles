#? Config file for bpytop v. 1.0.22

#* Color theme, looks for a .theme file in "/usr/[local/]share/bpytop/themes" and "~/.config/bpytop/themes", "Default" for builtin default theme.
#* Prefix name by a plus sign (+) for a theme located in user themes folder, i.e. color_theme="+monokai"
color_theme="nord"

#* If the theme set background should be shown, set to False if you want terminal background transparency
theme_background=False

#* Set bpytop view mode, "full" for everything shown, "proc" for cpu stats and processes, "stat" for cpu, mem, disks and net stats shown.
view_mode=full

#* Update time in milliseconds, increases automatically if set below internal loops processing time, recommended 2000 ms or above for better sample times for graphs.
update_ms=1000

#* Processes sorting, "pid" "program" "arguments" "threads" "user" "memory" "cpu lazy" "cpu responsive",
#* "cpu lazy" updates top process over time, "cpu responsive" updates top process directly.
proc_sorting="cpu lazy"

#* Reverse sorting order, True or False.
proc_reversed=False

#* Show processes as a tree
proc_tree=False

#* Use the cpu graph colors in the process list.
proc_colors=True

#* Use a darkening gradient in the process list.
proc_gradient=True

#* If process cpu usage should be of the core it's running on or usage of the total available cpu power.
proc_per_core=True

#* Show process memory as bytes instead of percent
proc_mem_bytes=True

#* Check cpu temperature, needs "osx-cpu-temp" on MacOS X.
check_temp=True

#* Draw a clock at top of screen, formatting according to strftime, empty string to disable.
draw_clock=""

#* Update main ui in background when menus are showing, set this to false if the menus is flickering too much for comfort.
background_update=True

#* Custom cpu model name, empty string to disable.
custom_cpu_name=""

#* Optional filter for shown disks, should be last folder in path of a mountpoint, "root" replaces "/", separate multiple values with comma.
#* Begin line with "exclude=" to change to exclude filter, oterwise defaults to "most include" filter. Example: disks_filter="exclude=boot, home"
disks_filter=""

#* Show graphs instead of meters for memory values.
mem_graphs=True

#* If swap memory should be shown in memory box.
show_swap=True

#* Show swap as a disk, ignores show_swap value above, inserts itself after first disk.
swap_disk=True

#* If mem box should be split to also show disks info.
show_disks=False

#* Set fixed values for network graphs, default "10M" = 10 Mibibytes, possible units "K", "M", "G", append with "bit" for bits instead of bytes, i.e "100mbit"
net_download="100Mbit"
net_upload="100Mbit"

#* Start in network graphs auto rescaling mode, ignores any values set above and rescales down to 10 Kibibytes at the lowest.
net_auto=True

#* Sync the scaling for download and upload to whichever currently has the highest scale
net_sync=False

#* If the network graphs color gradient should scale to bandwith usage or auto scale, bandwith usage is based on "net_download" and "net_upload" values
net_color_fixed=False

#* Show init screen at startup, the init screen is purely cosmetical
show_init=False

#* Enable check for new version from github.com/aristocratos/bpytop at start.
update_check=False

#* Set loglevel for "~/.config/bpytop/error.log" levels are: "ERROR" "WARNING" "INFO" "DEBUG".
#* The level set includes all lower levels, i.e. "DEBUG" will show all logging info.
