[Full Changelog](https://github.com/vscodevim/vim/compare/v0.17.3...v1.0.0)

The first commit to this project was a little over 3 years ago, and what a journey it's been. To celebrate the new year, we are pushing out v1.0.0 of VSCodeVim! In addition to this project reaching such an amazing milestone, but in my personal life, I'll soon be celebrating the birth of my first-born. With that in mind, over the last few weeks I've tried to close out as many issues as I could before all my spare time is filled with diapers and bottles. Thanks to amazing team of maintainers, contributors, and users that have brought us to where we are today and where we'll go tomorrow.

**Breaking Change:**
